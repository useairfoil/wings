//! Object store factory for creating ObjectStore instances from runtime configuration.
//!
//! This module provides the `ObjectStoreFactory` trait that allows components to create
//! `ObjectStore` clients dynamically based on secret configurations loaded at runtime.
//! The factory abstracts away the details of different object store implementations
//! (S3, Azure, GCS, etc.) and provides a unified interface for object store creation.
