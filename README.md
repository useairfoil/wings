# Wings

Wings is the streaming storage engine for Apache Iceberg. It's designed to ingest high-volume data concurrently while keeping Iceberg's metadata up-to-date.

In a medallion architecture data lakehouse, Wings is used for bronze (raw) and silver (cleaned, deduplicated) data.

Wings supports two modes, configurable by table: 

 - entities: row values are merged so that only the latest value is stored, with no duplicates. In this mode, partial updates are supported.
 - append only: every write adds data to the table.

The ingestion API is being redesigned. The current HTTP server exposes health checks and catalog management only.

At the moment, Wings _is not_ a general purpose storage engine. Data MUST go through the Wings ingestion service so that it can be validated and added to the table.

### Features

 - Multi tenant: manage multiple Iceberg catalogs with a single Wings cluster. Data from different tenants is never mixed together.
 - Separate cluster and catalog storage: operational data is stored separately from the catalogs data.
 - Operationally simple: there is no stateful dependency other than object storage. All components are stateless and can serve any tenant.
 - Apache Iceberg v3: support positional deletes with deletion vectors, semi structured data, and row lineage.
 - Rust + Arrow + DataFusion (RAD) stack: Wings builds on a solid foundation.
 - Open Source: Apache 2.0 license. You can run it locally or in your cloud without any vendor lock-in.

### Roadmap

 - [ ] Entity tables with configurable primary key and version columns.
 - [ ] Append only tables.
 - [ ] Clustering and sorting by non-PK column.
 - [ ] Apache Iceberg v4.

## Getting Started

Run `cargo run --bin wings -- dev` to start the HTTP server at
`http://127.0.0.1:7777`. Use `--server.address` or `WINGS_SERVER_ADDRESS` to
change the listen address. Configure the object-store provider, bucket and
credentials first (`--object-store.type`, `--object-store.bucket-name` and the
provider's environment variables); the file secret store uses that object store.

| Method | Path | Success response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | `200 OK` (liveness check, empty body) |
| POST | `/catalogs` | `201 Created`, catalog JSON and `Location` header |
| GET | `/catalogs/{id}` | `200 OK`, catalog JSON |
| DELETE | `/catalogs/{id}` | `204 No Content` (also when already absent) |
| GET | `/catalogs/{id}/v1/config` | `200 OK`, Iceberg REST client configuration |

Catalog configurations are persisted in the configured secret store, not a
database. There is intentionally no listing endpoint (`GET /catalogs` returns
`405 Method Not Allowed`).

```sh
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:7777/health
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:7777/catalogs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"catalog_id":"example","config":{"type":"rest","uri":"http://localhost:8181"}}'
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:7777/catalogs/example
curl -f -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:7777/catalogs/example
```

Create and get return `{"name":"catalogs/example","config":{"type":"rest","uri":"http://localhost:8181"}}`.
REST config also accepts optional `warehouse` and `properties` fields.
IDs use the existing catalog ID validation. Invalid IDs return `400`, missing
catalogs return `404`, and duplicate creation returns `409`. Invalid JSON returns
`400`, an invalid JSON schema returns `422`, and a missing JSON content type
returns `415`. Backend failures return `500` without exposing backend details.
The API has no authentication yet; keep it on a trusted interface, especially
because catalog properties may contain credentials.

### Iceberg REST catalog API

Each catalog has its own Iceberg REST base URI, for example
`http://127.0.0.1:7777/catalogs/example`. Currently only `GET /v1/config`
is implemented under that base URI:

```sh
curl -f 'http://127.0.0.1:7777/catalogs/example/v1/config?warehouse=example'
```

It returns `{"defaults":{},"overrides":{},"endpoints":[]}`. The optional
`warehouse` query parameter is accepted but ignored: the URL selects the catalog.
There are no client property defaults or overrides yet, and no namespace or table
operations are advertised. Upstream catalog connection properties and credentials
are not returned. Missing catalogs return `404`, invalid IDs return `400`, and
backend failures return `500`, using the Iceberg REST error response format.

Iceberg endpoint implementations live in `wings_server/src/iceberg/`, starting
with `config.rs`; namespace and table handlers will live alongside it as they are
implemented. Catalog-management endpoints remain separate.
